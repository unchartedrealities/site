    title: `Google's First VR Adventure based on much-beloved French film`,
    body: `In 1998, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added a stick figure drawing
    to their company’s homepage as a fun way to let visitors know they were out of office attending
     the Burning Man festival in Nevada. This gave rise to the company’s famous Google Doodles,
      which are usually designed to honor important historical events, influential people,
       and holidays, and have become a mainstay for the search engine ever since.

       Now, 20 years later, Google is launching its first ever Doodle in virtual reality to celebrate
        Georges Méliès, the French filmmaker and illusionist that some have called the
         “father of special effects.” Google is timing the Doodle’s launch to
          coincide with the release date of one of Méliès’ popular works,
           “À la conquête du pôle (The Conquest of the Pole),” which was released in 1912.`
